# My Personal Project (Title Pending)

## A text-based RPG

For my project, I would like to make a **text-based RPG** in which you'll be able to create a character with user-specified attributes in different categories. The character will then try to pass through randomly selected scenarios from a list of possible scenarios. The pass or fail will be dictated by the character's stats. Passing will reward items and/or stats that can help a character whereas failing will make the character take damage. How much damage will depend on the scenario. the game ends when the damage taken exceeds the health fo the character. 

The game will be open to anyone but I'm hoping that it will be enjoyable to fellow students who like RPG videos games or D&D. I've liked RPGs since my childhood so I would like to try and make one. I want to encorporate modularity so that my program can work as a framework for many different settings and scenarios. 

## User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to:
- create a character with certain attributes.
- have multiple characters independent to each other and list them.
- add and remove possible scenarios that happen in-game.
- add and remove items from an inventory that I can list.
- add stats to my character(s).
